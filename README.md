# Horiseon's Site Refactored

## Description

Horiseon's website previously contained a number of errors in general and those which impacted accessibility especially. Almost nothing changed visually (except for the red heart symbol in the footer--that was replaced with 'love' for accessibility).

The layout of the webpage is focused on three primary components of successful websites: search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. These three components each have their own division with blue backgrounds, illustrative images and basic descriptions of the components.

In addition, a side panel (division) contains three strategies or techniques valuable to business management. For each of these there are icon images which serve to symbolize those strategies/techniques.

Not much needed improvement, relative to the amount of code. The following major changes were made:

1. The title was improved
2. Alt attribute messages were added
3. For the first "search engine optimization" division, the code `id="search-engine-optimization"` was added to fix the internal hyperlink.
4. HTML sections were made semantic

Here is a screenshot of the webpage:
